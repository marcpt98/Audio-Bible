      What is an Audio Bible?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Audio Bible is a document normally written by the audio director that is used to establish all terms, rules, features 
      and processes related to the audio that all the team will strictly use and follow during the production of the game. Once 
      this document is written, it mustn’t be modified (at least the main points) in order to keep a regular and controllable 
      process of all the audio.
      This is an example of a “mini” audio bible for a demo:

    <h2>
      Why should we write an Audio Bible?
    </h2>
    <p>
      This document (apart from establishing the guidelines of the audio), will also help the rest of the team. Designers, 
      programmers and anyone else who is involved on the project will want to at least skim it. Whether it’s one page or a 
      hundred, it should be as clear and descriptive as possible for the person that writes it and the development team.

    <h2>
      Fundamental parts of an Audio Bible
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before starting with the implementation or materials, it’s required an overview about how the audio will be. There 
      are four fundamental pillars that helps to write the most important aspects about the audio: 
    </p>
    <h3>
      Music
    </h3>
    - Style: It has to be determined if it’s an energetic/rock music that will produce a sense of powerness to the player or 
    a relaxed music that will go along with an epic fantasy adventure. If the music is very energetic, breaks must be taken 
    into account in order to don’t exhaust the player. For example, in Doom (first image) when you fight against a lot of 
    enemies rock music starts to sound but in Journey (second image) is an epic and relaxed music during the game.

    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681255874605350953/wCbznDtJx2tAiEKqCddH0dWl5MQt0pUz3Fhn7737c5XFSHQqBljFKvnA069R9vK5Lm7p_Xjl2v78VXI3XmDU8zMlL0QAqTp2tndy.png?width=777&height=438">
    
    - Musicians/Instruments: The music can be performed by an entirely orchestra or a single person playing the guitar or 
    the piano. It has to be decided how many persons and music instruments will be used during the production of the game 
    depending on the audio that has to be recorded, this will also be very important for the game budget. This is an important 
    decision that starts to define what the personality of the project will have. For example, the first image is the recording 
    of the Dark Star Jhin soundtrack where only 4 musicians and the orchestra director but for the production of a main song in 
    Bloodborne were required an entirely orchestra (second and third image).
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681255956155334697/4lfANGTWMFRtDgXhW7IkF_SQbVLHLfmbUvO-cA5zmQ1qcnx-vWJNr-IQfPKb0PUGwivuHp5jDqVVD2zwq8dcEljTjr5Q3DRwZbwG.png?width=777&height=438">

    - Recording: The music can be recorded as a lot of individual tracks recorded in a studio or as a big performance of a 
    orchestra. The guy in the image is Greg Edmonson, a freelance composer.
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256008278212620/Sd8J5RsGacOTR3tV5E4jN3ilKJwf3PXW6IndYpUmunjT7whfPhP-xaKhtNa2MtNwjSkSGORrR3PdjUXMUlVS1Sqb06UEYtnhomrH.png?width=777&height=438">
    
    - Implementation: Decide if the audio will be a cross-fade based off of game parameter or is continuously playing within 
    your audio soundscape. For example, Super Meat Boy has a continuously audio.
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256029304127548/r1TK0Rr6wpr6P6cH6hXWdnvNbOCkI-eRbNsJAVcjquNw2T_Ggcy_q2P3Q5LQN6Eyj4CI4QEsGQUd3vf6Y1X1K7ynSrWF0AXPYY9S.png?width=860&height=384">
    
    <h3>
      Sound Design
    </h3>
    - Ambience: How complex and layered is the sound of the game. It’s required to known if the game world is cyberpunk, 
    medieval, sci-fi, fantastic… with this characteristic chosen, all the audio has to fit with this theme to produce a 
    good environment and atmosphere. For example the majority of The Witcher 3 (second image) sounds and Cyberpunk 2077 
    (first image) will never fit if they were changed between each other. 
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256050208407554/qHGrcso3a59HEoB30j4QMYii7GXQLNsT13cBfKFxSfxchtQ6xHzY48CiVCRAgCQt3y5M0uuMV6D_UsRlTGsOJzodoEY3xJ5pjUTh.png?width=699&height=437">
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256069229707294/wGVEJTnu7VKlGyFV10516QiQjIO6btCsCrrH6WHYxcgKaS7ZD5DFe0MHVaYCmDvsf-Y_jkjreExgxI1sGZ5fumuz4JLlIBpoCetq.png?width=583&height=438">
    
    - Interaction: This aspect is all the items and elements that the player will interact with like weapons, ropes or power ups. 
    Depending on the ambience, we can deduce the type of sounds that are needed and if there will be a main sound (like a gun 
    in the FPS). In a medieval world all sounds related to space or futuristic can be completely discarded. For example, the 
    futuristic bow of Destiny 2 (first image) can’t have the same sound as a Chivalry bow (second image).
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256093028319247/6748AOiYU0Kk_62SLJBE7X0y6CLieyNoTEpGDdIwSo9Ev8rd2IM7fT2dDHTIAOzUtvTuggfWv05xxEWKewrEq0zKj8Bvczaiwckf.png?width=655&height=437">

    - Enemies: Define how will be the encounters that the player will have with his enemies: It’ll be an epic bossfight? 
    A random and weak enemy? It’ll break a wall for an epic entrance or will fall from above the character? Every sound 
    that the enemy produce must be related to the type that is assigned. For example, the fight against Pontiff Sulyvahn 
    (first image) can’t have the same sound as a fight against a random skeleton (second image).
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256149621801244/d-tmpWcVzdR5y5lFjIgiGB6bSTjSMqWDUwY-wUCc2ehFD85ROD2Jzk10_LWK0fgNclJ40nENQKh0JEqJ7MIvYOT7Jqyaix04UTxt.png?width=777&height=438">

    <br/>
    - Sound Effects: There are a lot of sounds not related to the ambience, interaction or enemies that are very important and 
    make a game from a mediocre audio to an excellent one with a good atmosphere. This sounds are events that the player can’t 
    control like a rock falling down a cliff, a steam blast from a sewer system when the character is passing by or terrifying 
    random sounds that all horrors game have in certains parts. As it is said, these sounds are not part of the previous sound 
    types but help to add more realism and atmosphere. For example, Amnesia uses very good this type of sounds to produce terror 
    to the player.
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256167309443117/KytDF43I7_dBrfTOuYtMjoIrxnUBQyMRb6wGNSrGKKPRL-b6pZYOTb5lvLxWv_LMG4J-tmycXOc90qUDCrSUUSDEVjKItdr1aIh6.png?width=777&height=438">
    
    - Player: This is a point that not many people think about when starting with the sound design because they already take it 
    for granted but is actually a very important question: Does the game have a player? If it has one, should be considered the 
    sounds for movement, footsteps, running, death, jump… If there’s not a character, these sounds can be avoidable.
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681261628280537128/nathan-drake-no-recibe-disparos-uncharted.png?width=859&height=401">
    
    - Dynamism: Will the game have a lot of peaks and valleys or will be a constant music? The game needs a good distribution 
    of the music type and the energy of the music that is used in every part of the game. 

    <h3>
      Voice Over
    </h3>
    - Story and gameplay: It has to be defined which voices will be made for the story lines and for the background and 
    ambientation of the game. It’s not the same when the character is walking in GTA (first image) and listens a random 
    conversation or is speaking with only one character in a cutscene like in Uncharted (second image).

    - Cast Size/Voice types: The game will require general voices for the ambientiation and principal voices for the main 
    characters or the narrator. Depending of the game, it’s needed different voice frequencies, ages, gender… A list has to 
    be made for the number of persons that are needed in order to make all the voices that the game need. For example, Jodie 
    from Beyond: Two Souls (first image) will need a different voice than Calus from Destiny 2 (second image).

    - Special Effect Voices: Apart from the general voices, there will be some of them that will need some additional 
    processing and sound design like a computer or a monster voice.

    <h3>
      Technology
    </h3>
    - Platform: In order to make a good organization and a fast implementation, all the team must use the same program, audio 
    format and names.
    - Audio channels: Will the game be a 2D platformer with a background music and some sound effects or a war game with 
    hundreds of persons, buildings and vehicles? The program and the working method of editing and putting the audio may vary 
    depending to the decision and, of course, the audio complexity and the time that it’ll take.
    - Implementation: Which methods or technology are you going to use in order to obtain the best and most immersive sound? 
    It is needed to think about all the materials and technology that will be required to produce all the audio.

    <h2>
      Audio implementation example
    </h2>
    There are a lot of ways to implement an audio to the game but it is normally made by layers. This is a real example 
    of the audio implementation for the game Zeus: Master of Olympus summed up in some lines (This audio engine harnesses 
    up to six distinct layers of sound):
    - Layer 0: This is the ambient sound layer. As the player passes over certain types of the map, that terrain ambient 
    sound loop begins to play. If the area changes, the first track fades out while a new track fades in. There can be only 
    two ambient sounds crossfading into one another at a time.
    - Layer 1: Make a 3D sound engine where the sounds can travel through a four-speaker system, complete with a parameter 
    list defining each sound’s path and travelling speed.
    - Layer 2: Ambient sounds generated from terrain and buildings, which will produce sound occasionally and are randomly 
    selected. This is made to complement the ambient track of the Layer 0.
    - Layer 3: All the songs related to the civilians, animals, monsters and combat. It’s also included the disaster and 
    UI sounds.
    - Layer 4: Interactive system where the music is played based on the game event. “General” music is played when there’s 
    no event, “Action” music is played when there’s a combat and “Special” music is played when there’s an important event.
    - Layer 5: All the narration and the in-game dialogues of all characters.
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256304571842605/VMCTtBo9N4VDIjIEiRJIe3m9FrHW69uowT5Xryyzfyu10Tsq0tQOm7ouz25Lq8tGPf9YnxcK3LrAqZbhYOGlgxDAwIIDEoXdpgxU.png">
    
    <h2>
      Content list
    </h2>
    Apart from all the songs of the game, there are also other ones so it’s needed to sort it all of them. 
    One way to sort all the audio is like this:
    - Sound design: Action sounds, explosions, weapons, characters (not dialogue) and UI.
    - Music: Menu music, in-game music, options music, win/lose music... 
    - Dialogue: in-game characters and narration.
    - Additional audio: Demos, marketing, web site, promos, in-game animations...

    <h2>
      Schedule
    </h2>
    There should be a part that specify about the milestones of the audio. There must be information about when the 
    differents parts of the audio will be finished and who and how many persons are working in every feature and how 
    much time they have to spend on it. This can be updated about every month in order to keep a dynamic workflow.

    <h2>
      Design production checklist
    </h2>
    Leaving appart the general points of producing and making the audio, there are some elements that every audio director 
    has to take care of:
    - Personal Continuity/Quality: There will be more than one composer or sound designer? Will they styles blend well 
    together? Does anyone need additional training or an explanation of the game background, process or software?
    - Technical Continuity/Quality: Are all the files in the right format with the correct name, not damaged and without 
    any noise? Does all the audio work in any computer, console, speaker or sound target? Does the voice have clean starts 
    and finishes without unusual rhythm patterns?
    - Overall testing: What main areas of the game need to be tested for the audio?
    - CPU performance testing: Could the game perform bad due to too many audio files playing simultaneously? Can the code 
    optimize the audio performance?
    - Limits testing: How many sounds can be played at the same time? What if the same sound is played by multiples sources 
    simultaneously? What happens if someone toggles the music off and turns it on again?
    - Relevancy: Which are the important areas to focus from a programming perspective? Will this code improve the audio or 
    will be a waste of time?
    - Technology trade-offs: Investigate which is the best audio format and program for the game (WAV, MP3, DirectMusic).
