      What is an Audio Bible?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Audio Bible is a document normally written by the audio director that is used to establish all terms, rules, features 
      and processes related to the audio that all the team will strictly use and follow during the production of the game. Once 
      this document is written, it mustn’t be modified (at least the main points) in order to keep a regular and controllable 
      process of all the audio.
      This is an example of a “mini” audio bible for a demo:

    <h2>
      Why should we write an Audio Bible?
    </h2>
    <p>
      This document (apart from establishing the guidelines of the audio), will also help the rest of the team. Designers, 
      programmers and anyone else who is involved on the project will want to at least skim it. Whether it’s one page or a 
      hundred, it should be as clear and descriptive as possible for the person that writes it and the development team.

    <h2>
      Fundamental parts of an Audio Bible
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before starting with the implementation or materials, it’s required an overview about how the audio will be. There 
      are four fundamental pillars that helps to write the most important aspects about the audio: 
    </p>
    <h3>
      Music
    </h3>
    - Style: It has to be determined if it’s an energetic/rock music that will produce a sense of powerness to the player or 
    a relaxed music that will go along with an epic fantasy adventure. If the music is very energetic, breaks must be taken 
    into account in order to don’t exhaust the player. For example, in Doom (first image) when you fight against a lot of 
    enemies rock music starts to sound but in Journey (second image) is an epic and relaxed music during the game.

    - Musicians/Instruments: The music can be performed by an entirely orchestra or a single person playing the guitar or 
    the piano. It has to be decided how many persons and music instruments will be used during the production of the game 
    depending on the audio that has to be recorded, this will also be very important for the game budget. This is an important 
    decision that starts to define what the personality of the project will have. For example, the first image is the recording 
    of the Dark Star Jhin soundtrack where only 4 musicians and the orchestra director but for the production of a main song in 
    Bloodborne were required an entirely orchestra (second and third image).

    - Recording: The music can be recorded as a lot of individual tracks recorded in a studio or as a big performance of a 
    orchestra. The guy in the image is Greg Edmonson, a freelance composer.

     How to play (controls):
    </h2>
       <h3>
    Character controls:
    </h3>
    - A: Move left </br>
    - D: Move right </br>
    - F: Shoot </br>
    - SPACE BAR: Jump </br>
     <h3>
    Special controls:
    </h3>
    - F1: Charge level 1 from the begining </br>
    - F2: Charge level 2 from the begining </br>
    - F3: Charge current level from the begining </br>
    - F5: Save your current position </br>
    - F6: Load your past position </br>
    - F8: Show all UI debug </br>
    - F9: Show all colliders and pathfinding </br>
    - F10: God mode (player without collisions and can fly) </br>
    - F11: Cap frames (siwtch fps cap between 30-60) </br>
    - º: Open console </br>

<h2>
     Innovation:
</h2>
- Enemy states and patrol </br>
- Game pause </br>
- Jump particles</br>
- Coldown on projectiles </br>
- Particle effects </br>
- Checkpoints </br>
- Every 1000 points you gain an extra life (if you get 1000 points (an extra life) and die, </br>
you have to get to 2000 points for another extra life)

<h2>
     Main core subsystems
</h2>
This game has 3 main core subsystems: </br>
- Entity core: in charge of the management of all the objects in the game (player, enemies with pathfinding, coins and checkpoints). This core controls the addition, elimination, save and load of all entities. All the management can be controlled throught the EntityManager module. Every entity has his own movement, states and physics but they share variables that are located in the Entity module. </br>
- UI core: in charge of the management of all HUD in the game (windows, menus, buttons, sliders, images and texts). This core, like the entity core, can control the addition, elimination of his elements. All the management can be controlled throught the Gui and SceneUI modules. Every UI also have some common variables and are located in the UI_element module. </br>
- Scene core: in charge of the management of the maps and keybinds of the game. All the management can be controlled throught the Scene module. In this module you can control the load and unload of the maps and music. Also, in this module you have all the keybinds functionality. </br>
