      What is an Audio Bible?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Audio Bible is a document normally written by the audio director that is used to establish all terms, rules, features 
      and processes related to the audio that all the team will strictly use and follow during the production of the game. Once 
      this document is written, it mustn’t be modified (at least the main points) in order to keep a regular and controllable 
      process of all the audio.
      This is an example of a “mini” audio bible for a demo:

    <h2>
      Why should we write an Audio Bible?
    </h2>
    <p>
      This document (apart from establishing the guidelines of the audio), will also help the rest of the team. Designers, 
      programmers and anyone else who is involved on the project will want to at least skim it. Whether it’s one page or a 
      hundred, it should be as clear and descriptive as possible for the person that writes it and the development team.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Fundamental parts of an Audio Bible
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before starting with the implementation or materials, it’s required an overview about how the audio will be. There 
      are four fundamental pillars that helps to write the most important aspects about the audio: 
    </p>
    <h3>
      Music
    </h3>
    - Style: It has to be determined if it’s an energetic/rock music that will produce a sense of powerness to the player or 
    a relaxed music that will go along with an epic fantasy adventure. If the music is very energetic, breaks must be taken 
    into account in order to don’t exhaust the player. For example, in Doom (first image) when you fight against a lot of 
    enemies rock music starts to sound but in Journey (second image) is an epic and relaxed music during the game.
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681255904448217119/OsyUKTX5BK-bwpGbRw1LeRhYXGpMiKJHKUvnSRmIee_RG6Ez94TxCO5AL56wqdco704d9p6nyLHrih5ozVT_hFefdvvNKVKr_3TZ.png?width=777&height=438">
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681255874605350953/wCbznDtJx2tAiEKqCddH0dWl5MQt0pUz3Fhn7737c5XFSHQqBljFKvnA069R9vK5Lm7p_Xjl2v78VXI3XmDU8zMlL0QAqTp2tndy.png?width=777&height=438">
    
    - Musicians/Instruments: The music can be performed by an entirely orchestra or a single person playing the guitar or 
    the piano. It has to be decided how many persons and music instruments will be used during the production of the game 
    depending on the audio that has to be recorded, this will also be very important for the game budget. This is an important 
    decision that starts to define what the personality of the project will have. For example, the first image is the recording 
    of the Dark Star Jhin soundtrack where only 4 musicians and the orchestra director but for the production of a main song in 
    Bloodborne were required an entirely orchestra (second and third image).
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681255956155334697/4lfANGTWMFRtDgXhW7IkF_SQbVLHLfmbUvO-cA5zmQ1qcnx-vWJNr-IQfPKb0PUGwivuHp5jDqVVD2zwq8dcEljTjr5Q3DRwZbwG.png?width=777&height=438">

    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681255982675787806/A8zzNOrodfZkbsjnMbrDJQI_fLww-DULGBHMiNh4TfdmSqF4AAba6PDijer5O4vVQegZRkSSZQx7OBcOmVBy2SawljM3VNVQV_vH.png?width=777&height=438">
    
    - Recording: The music can be recorded as a lot of individual tracks recorded in a studio or as a big performance of a 
    orchestra. The guy in the image is Greg Edmonson, a freelance composer.
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256008278212620/Sd8J5RsGacOTR3tV5E4jN3ilKJwf3PXW6IndYpUmunjT7whfPhP-xaKhtNa2MtNwjSkSGORrR3PdjUXMUlVS1Sqb06UEYtnhomrH.png?width=777&height=438">
    
    - Implementation: Decide if the audio will be a cross-fade based off of game parameter or is continuously playing within 
    your audio soundscape. For example, Super Meat Boy has a continuously audio.
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256029304127548/r1TK0Rr6wpr6P6cH6hXWdnvNbOCkI-eRbNsJAVcjquNw2T_Ggcy_q2P3Q5LQN6Eyj4CI4QEsGQUd3vf6Y1X1K7ynSrWF0AXPYY9S.png?width=860&height=384">
    
    <h3>
      Sound Design
    </h3>
    - Ambience: How complex and layered is the sound of the game. It’s required to known if the game world is cyberpunk, 
    medieval, sci-fi, fantastic… with this characteristic chosen, all the audio has to fit with this theme to produce a 
    good environment and atmosphere. For example the majority of The Witcher 3 (second image) sounds and Cyberpunk 2077 
    (first image) will never fit if they were changed between each other. 
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256050208407554/qHGrcso3a59HEoB30j4QMYii7GXQLNsT13cBfKFxSfxchtQ6xHzY48CiVCRAgCQt3y5M0uuMV6D_UsRlTGsOJzodoEY3xJ5pjUTh.png?width=699&height=437">
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256069229707294/wGVEJTnu7VKlGyFV10516QiQjIO6btCsCrrH6WHYxcgKaS7ZD5DFe0MHVaYCmDvsf-Y_jkjreExgxI1sGZ5fumuz4JLlIBpoCetq.png?width=583&height=438">
    
    - Interaction: This aspect is all the items and elements that the player will interact with like weapons, ropes or power ups. 
    Depending on the ambience, we can deduce the type of sounds that are needed and if there will be a main sound (like a gun 
    in the FPS). In a medieval world all sounds related to space or futuristic can be completely discarded. For example, the 
    futuristic bow of Destiny 2 (first image) can’t have the same sound as a Chivalry bow (second image).
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256093028319247/6748AOiYU0Kk_62SLJBE7X0y6CLieyNoTEpGDdIwSo9Ev8rd2IM7fT2dDHTIAOzUtvTuggfWv05xxEWKewrEq0zKj8Bvczaiwckf.png?width=655&height=437">
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256112065871932/G8xLlEN7927dgAsBMNHNLIVLnLatrK3bJnNzMj_do0XzwR6v7S8uRWkKoR1XGxGTWjVTttjZvmk-mZPNXlIJRBi7Pl2_C20sXpws.png?width=777&height=438">
    
    - Enemies: Define how will be the encounters that the player will have with his enemies: It’ll be an epic bossfight? 
    A random and weak enemy? It’ll break a wall for an epic entrance or will fall from above the character? Every sound 
    that the enemy produce must be related to the type that is assigned. For example, the fight against Pontiff Sulyvahn 
    (first image) can’t have the same sound as a fight against a random skeleton (second image).
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256149621801244/d-tmpWcVzdR5y5lFjIgiGB6bSTjSMqWDUwY-wUCc2ehFD85ROD2Jzk10_LWK0fgNclJ40nENQKh0JEqJ7MIvYOT7Jqyaix04UTxt.png?width=777&height=438">
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256129933869126/bhh8WrqLDdFbks01-oudtRVfLLI3nf_jQ7wm6-WNsRai2cTxi5ekxU8_KrIUlod2rLXq5r9VYaLIjJkke-67af_muI-hd8ZgqArn.png?width=293&height=437">
    
    - Sound Effects: There are a lot of sounds not related to the ambience, interaction or enemies that are very important and 
    make a game from a mediocre audio to an excellent one with a good atmosphere. This sounds are events that the player can’t 
    control like a rock falling down a cliff, a steam blast from a sewer system when the character is passing by or terrifying 
    random sounds that all horrors game have in certains parts. As it is said, these sounds are not part of the previous sound 
    types but help to add more realism and atmosphere. For example, Amnesia uses very good this type of sounds to produce terror 
    to the player.
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256167309443117/KytDF43I7_dBrfTOuYtMjoIrxnUBQyMRb6wGNSrGKKPRL-b6pZYOTb5lvLxWv_LMG4J-tmycXOc90qUDCrSUUSDEVjKItdr1aIh6.png?width=777&height=438">
    
    - Player: This is a point that not many people think about when starting with the sound design because they already take it 
    for granted but is actually a very important question: Does the game have a player? If it has one, should be considered the 
    sounds for movement, footsteps, running, death, jump… If there’s not a character, these sounds can be avoidable.
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681261628280537128/nathan-drake-no-recibe-disparos-uncharted.png?width=859&height=401">
    
    - Dynamism: Will the game have a lot of peaks and valleys or will be a constant music? The game needs a good distribution 
    of the music type and the energy of the music that is used in every part of the game. 

    <h3>
      Voice Over
    </h3>
    - Story and gameplay: It has to be defined which voices will be made for the story lines and for the background and 
    ambientation of the game. It’s not the same when the character is walking in GTA (first image) and listens a random 
    conversation or is speaking with only one character in a cutscene like in Uncharted (second image).
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256185839485023/bGq68bl61Azb5DsW1-Q_BxnvDDwU0Z70WDjQvcJcQn8TYZ6Y8qH2XSQFjPt4faMnANlEOgY7x9xHprSZDAUqi_QobQfKY_3oP__-.png">

    - Cast Size/Voice types: The game will require general voices for the ambientiation and principal voices for the main 
    characters or the narrator. Depending of the game, it’s needed different voice frequencies, ages, gender… A list has to 
    be made for the number of persons that are needed in order to make all the voices that the game need. For example, Jodie 
    from Beyond: Two Souls (first image) will need a different voice than Calus from Destiny 2 (second image).

    - Special Effect Voices: Apart from the general voices, there will be some of them that will need some additional 
    processing and sound design like a computer or a monster voice.
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555497331848380447/681256250813448323/Kk3IoqnVHEX28piR1atZpX1EsGSeIzfPHfBRFD-ANA3vXWEUVpguXbZUDjL0xvf2QwOOGox4lRg41GpWnWEh9t7Lvwrop2LCiKPP.png?width=774&height=437">
    
    <h3>
      Technology
    </h3>
    - Platform: In order to make a good organization and a fast implementation, all the team must use the same program, audio 
    format and names.
    - Audio channels: Will the game be a 2D platformer with a background music and some sound effects or a war game with 
    hundreds of persons, buildings and vehicles? The program and the working method of editing and putting the audio may vary 
    depending to the decision and, of course, the audio complexity and the time that it’ll take.
    - Implementation: Which methods or technology are you going to use in order to obtain the best and most immersive sound? 
    It is needed to think about all the materials and technology that will be required to produce all the audio.

    - F11: Cap frames (siwtch fps cap between 30-60) </br>
    - º: Open console </br>

<h2>
     Innovation:
</h2>
- Enemy states and patrol </br>
- Game pause </br>
- Jump particles</br>
- Coldown on projectiles </br>
- Particle effects </br>
- Checkpoints </br>
- Every 1000 points you gain an extra life (if you get 1000 points (an extra life) and die, </br>
you have to get to 2000 points for another extra life)

<h2>
     Main core subsystems
</h2>
This game has 3 main core subsystems: </br>
- Entity core: in charge of the management of all the objects in the game (player, enemies with pathfinding, coins and checkpoints). This core controls the addition, elimination, save and load of all entities. All the management can be controlled throught the EntityManager module. Every entity has his own movement, states and physics but they share variables that are located in the Entity module. </br>
- UI core: in charge of the management of all HUD in the game (windows, menus, buttons, sliders, images and texts). This core, like the entity core, can control the addition, elimination of his elements. All the management can be controlled throught the Gui and SceneUI modules. Every UI also have some common variables and are located in the UI_element module. </br>
- Scene core: in charge of the management of the maps and keybinds of the game. All the management can be controlled throught the Scene module. In this module you can control the load and unload of the maps and music. Also, in this module you have all the keybinds functionality. </br>
